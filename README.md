Deploy dibbr to your server by building .NET Linux (Visual Studio->Publish) and run nohup /path/to/dibbr

While many of you enjoy Python, this bot has some awesome features worthy of using C#. Runs on windows or mac or linux. Build yourself.

Dibbr is a bot so you can add him to your discord. Then activate him with your OpenAI key (free).

If you've used ChatGPT, dibbr is like the unrestricted version.

dabbr: Britney spears is [age] --> dabbr: Britney spears is 41
